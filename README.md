# Linux Shortcut Creator

This is a simple shortcut creator for Linux systems because some distributions lack a native "Add to Desktop" feature. This Python script lets you easily create shortcuts for your desktop.

## Setup

1. Install Python
2. Install Tkinter
3. Run the script in your terminal

## Notes

This script was made using AI, and might not work by default. I originally made this for myself, but decided that i should release it since others with the same problem would appreciate it.
